When you first start for the day always do a pull in the drone directory
	
	git pull

When you want to push changes you've made, add them, commit them, and push them

	git pull		(always pull before you push)

	git add .		(to add all changes made in the directory)
		OR
	git add File_Name	(to add changes made on a particular file
				if you're not ready to push other changes made yet)

	
	git commit -m "Write comment here"
	
	git push



Other cool commands to know
	
	git diff		(to show all the changes between the files on
				your system and the files pushed to github so far.
				Shows nothing if there are no chagnes)

	git diff FileName	(show changes between github and your system for
				a specific file if changes have been made)
	
	git reset		(removes all files from the staging area and will
				have to be readded)

	git status		(shows if modified files have been staged <green>
				or not staged yet <red>)
	git log			(shows a log of all the pushes we have made)
